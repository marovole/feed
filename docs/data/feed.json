    "content": "biased as i wrote blog on this topic but tldr:\n- Factory Droid/codex/CC/AMP are all coding agents, they’re products!\n- But they’re each products that take a very opinionated and careful design for what “stuff” to put around the model to make them good at coding.  Tool design, system prompts, multi-model choices, subagent design, etc.  All of that stuff is the “harness”, ie. the set of things you put around the model to get the best perf for your task\n- this is because models have spiky intelligence across tasks and are non-fungible in a harness, so you can optimize the stuff around them to elicit the best perf for your task\n- finally, there’s a world where Harness Design is open!  DeepAgents from @LangChainAI is one of example at the first steps towards that, where you start with an opinionated harness but users have freedom to edit all parts of it.  There will be a place for both design choices imo\n\nhttps://t.co/x0FFnkmVZQ",
