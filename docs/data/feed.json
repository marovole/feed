    "content": "Droid Author/Owner.. please provide release updates\n\nHey there,\n\nI see one person that responds that I assume is from FactoryAI from time to time asking about bugs, etc. Can that person or someone from the FactorAI/Droid team when they put out NEW droid updates, share a post here on this forum for the few of us here to read. It would be very helpful to see what changes/additions/features were made each time there is an update. \n\nThank you.",

I downloaded Droid CLI and tried to create an account, expecting a 20 million token free trial to test things out. However, the signup process was a nightmare. It involved two-factor authentication, email verification, and repeatedly entering my phone number. I'd enter my number, they'd send a code, then it would ask for two-factor authentication.
