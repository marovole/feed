If you don't sub to both/all providers Amp is attempting to use, you wont have it configured in CLIProxyAPI and it will fall back to routing through the Amp proxy (where they charge/deduct the token use from your wallet balance), but it will still work.\n\nI sub to both openai and anthropic, so smart mode (currently sonnet 4.5) routes to anthropic with subscription oauth use and if i invoke oracle, it routes to openai gpt-5 using sub oauth.\n\n But, if you have a 0 balance in Amp, of course the model call for provider not authenticated/configured in CLIProxyAPI would fail in the Amp proxy.\n\nYou can see the models and providers for the modes and subagents here: https://t.co/zbLRhQshqI",
