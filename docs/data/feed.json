GPT 5-1 Low feel like a drop in replacement for Sonnet 4.5 so far.\n4.1) GPT 5-1 Low is like a smarter rush while being cheaper*\n5) @FactoryAI used to have this issue, but its fixed now. Basically @AmpCode is primed for software engineering. If I prime Amp with knowledge of a custom cli, can it take that and run? Claude Code seems to be born for random things like that.\n6) Skills approach",

    "content": "Been using Claude Code, Codex, and @FactoryAI Droid CLI with various models to do this migration and I’ve noticed GPT 5/5.1 High in Codex has been the best for writing code in a @tan_stack Start (TSS) project. Codex does a much better job actually looking up the latest documentation for TSS, which is important for such a new framework as things change quickly. Otherwise it ends up writing a bunch of NextJS-like code and weird bugs start popping up. All these models don’t know much about TSS by default in their training dataset clearly.\n\nAlso I specify Codex because when I ran GPT 5/5.1 High in Droid CLI I was getting much lower quality output than via Codex.\n\nMake sure to set “web_search_request = true” in your Codex config.toml to ensure it can access the latest info! It’s off by default.",

    "content": "[Issue] Extension not working in WSL\n\nHi, my usual setup consists of VSC connecting to WSL Debian where all my projects reside. The Claude Code extension for VSC works perfectly fine in this setup, however I found that the droid extension is not recognized by the CLI when a WSL workspace is open. It instantly starts working when i open the windows native droid CLI in a non WSL workspace in VSC. I also found that trying to install the extension through the `/settings` menu simply fails when inside WSL. ",
