Seeing some interesting use-cases with custom /droids.\n\nNow here's the challenge I'm taking on:\nI'm subscribing to the $20/mo plan today and using ONLY Droid for everything over the next 1-2 weeks. \n\nAll my work - brainstorming, deep research, copywriting, design iterations, code, etc. - everything.\n\nI don't think $20/mo will cover a week of how I work, and most likely, I'd run out of tokens in a week - which is exactly why I'm doing this. It'll force me to figure out:\n- New ways to save tokens without losing output quality\n- More efficient workflows under constraint\n- Where custom droids actually unlock leverage\n- What breaks when you push the limits\n\nI'll share what I find as I go - token hacks, workflow tweaks, edge cases, all of it.\n\nIf there's something specific you'd like me to explore or stress-test with Droid, drop it below. I'll pick a few challenging ones and document the process.\n\nHere's to Droid week! 🥂",
