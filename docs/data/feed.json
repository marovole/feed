I had a bitch of a time getting it to actually work as described… Key for me was running a process on all of the droids to remove ‘Task’ from the list of available tools for a large handful of the droids. Having this tool assigned was causing sub agents to fail immediately when launched by the orchestrator. After removing that from their list of available tools, the orchestrator successfully launched multiple sub agents/droids simultaneously. Pretty bad ass. If you’re having trouble getting the orchestrator to launch the sub agents, check out the issues in the GitHub repo I posted more details there.",
