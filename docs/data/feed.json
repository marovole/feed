    "content": "fell in love with Droid\n\nAfter reading big article from @bentossell and looking at @pipelineabuser posts I decided to give @FactoryAI Droid a try. And, damn, it’s cool. Used all of 1M free tokens in less than a day and immediately bought a Pro sub\n\nI was a little bit hesitant about my decision and my choice of niche so I booted up Droid in the terminal, chose Sonnet 4.5 and asked him to be my coach/mentor. And I was instantly amazed by the depth of his answers and clarifying questions. I was comparing it to the web version of Claude Sonnet 4.5 in a similar conversation and the differences are huge. Don’t know exactly why, but it is how it is. Droid’s answers gave me more motivation, more energy, made the choice more accurate. I’ve liked Droid from the begging. \n\nSpent first couple of hours with him discussing the plan execution, what to do and what not to do. And the rest of the day following our newly made plan, starting from the beginning. Researching @Morpho protocol docs, taking notes in Obsidian. I even connected Droid to Obsidian via MCP\n\nAt some point of time I was too excited and asking too many questions so clanker even started bullying me\n\nAnyways, looking forward to start actually building things with Droid. Should be an interesting journey ahead",

    "content": "I've been running a few experiments with CLI tools for the past few weeks - Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, and @droid - and I'm finding myself reaching for them more than Cursor or Bolt.\n\nThat's pushed me to rethink my subscription stack for this year.\n\nHere's where I'm stuck:\n\nOption A: \n$100 Claude \n$20 on Droid (using GLM4.7 for most tasks) \n$20-$30 in OpenRouter credits\n\nOption B: \n$20 on Droid \n$60-80 in OpenRouter credits. \n$20 Cursor\n$20 Claude\nI find myself using GLM4.7 (droid core) for 80% of the time and switching to Sonnet/Opus/Gemini/Codex only when it fails.\n\nI'm not going with $200 on Claude because I can't drop Droid - their harness is too smooth, and it just works. If they offered a $100 plan, this would be easy. But they don't (for now!).\n\nThe other concern with the Claude sub is how fast it burns through tokens. That makes me cautious about relying on it as my primary setup.\n\nI'm leaning toward Option B, mostly because I love the harness Droid has built. But before I commit, I'd like to hear from anyone who's used both Claude Code and Droid regularly.\n\nWhat pros and cons have you noticed - especially if you're working on complex projects?",

    "content": "Day 4: Update 1\n\nGrok now officially on code review / QA duty.\n\nStarted routing everything through a tighter loop: brain dump → Grok organizes → @factoryai builds → Grok reviews for bugs, style, edge cases → commit.\n\nScreenshot from this morning says it all: Grok convo open on the right, WIP app on the left. Both of us immediately spotted the broken thumbnail preview — classic edge case where a weird crop threw the canvas resize off.\n\nThrew it back to the loop: quick spec to FactoryAI → Grok caught an off-by-one → fixed in ~2 minutes. Smooth.\n\nAlso cleaned up the add/export flow, cut a couple unnecessary steps, and added CSV loading so I can now import old “Training Session” data, not just full rounds.\n\nTool’s quietly becoming the golf journal I actually want. \n\nThis evening I'll start building out an actual backlog.\n\nFor now - Sim Time. ⛳",

If I’m not mistaken, signing up used to give ~10–20M free tokens (not sure if that’s still active).\n\nCursor is great if you live inside an IDE  personally, I’m not a big fan.\n\nIf you prefer a CLI-first workflow, Claude Code is hard to beat. The usage limits reset every ~5 hours, so a direct Anthropic subscription gives solid value for money.\n\nFactory’s CLI, though, is excellent and almost on par with Claude Code. The real edge: flexibility. You can mix cheaper models (GLM-4.7, Claude Haiku, Gemini 3 Flash) with high-end ones (Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro) depending on the task.\n\nPlus, their auto-compact context compression is one of the best — it frees up context window without losing continuity.",

    "content": "Your project feedback is probably scattered across messages, mental notes, and half-remembered conversations.\n\nMine used to be the same until I built a simple system with @droid  that seems to work quite good.\n\nThe workflow is straightforward: I maintain a https://t.co/1Kf9Jhu1gH file in my project root. While testing or using the product, I feed Droid my observations and ask it to document them in that file. Each entry captures three things: where the issue showed up, what's currently happening, and what should happen instead. No solutions yet, just clarity on the problem.\n\nOnce I have enough documented feedback, I tag the file and ask Droid to create an implementation plan. I review it, refine if needed, and then let Droid execute.\n\nSince I found myself repeating this loop across projects, I created a custom droid specifically for this. It maintains the https://t.co/1Kf9Jhu1gH structure, asks clarifying questions when my input is vague, and generates implementation plans without me having to prompt the same workflow every time.\n\nThe system prompt is in the screenshot. It shows how the droid handles location context, current issues, and desired outcomes without making assumptions or jumping to solutions prematurely.\n\nFor anyone building with @FactoryAI  or similar orchestration tools, this structure has saved me a lot of time in managing scattered context switching. Instead of losing track of what needs fixing, everything lives in one file that feeds directly into the next build cycle.\n\nAnyone else using a similar feedback loop with their AI tools?",

It just... works?\n\nThis feels like \"too good to be true\". \n\nI'm used to error loops and often feel I have to lead the architecture with most products - but with Droid, that's not the case. With it almost one-shotting every major ask that I have, I am spending most of my time testing - and finding no bugs (and honestly - its a bit boring!). \n\nEither I'm slowing down, or missing something, or Droid's actually crazy?\n\nJokes aside - what a mighty crazy product by @FactoryAI - made me rethink all my subscription and tooling strategy.",

For example I have vercel's `ai` repo cloned locally, and then if I'm building something related to AI SDK, like one of my community providers for claude agent sdk or codex cli, I'll tell the model the location of the `ai` codebase implementing AI SDK and let it use it to fully understand the capabilities, types, etc - I find having the repo actually cloned and fully accessible typically works a lot better than using MCPs to explore dependency codebases.",

    "content": "Just getting into harnesses and agent coding I’d strongly recommend using subscriptions with clause code and/or codex and the $20 plans, then upgrading to $100 and eventually $200 plans if needed. Those provide you by far the most inference per dollar.\n\nThen those same subs can be used with opencode, droid, and amp with plugins in opencode (oc ships with the Anthropic one), or CLIProxyAPI I’ve found very stable with both droid and amp.\n\nDroid and Amp are both very good, like ice cream, you have to use and decide which flavor you like best compared to provider harnesses. I honestly use them all and rotate for various workflows. Different people will prefer one over the other, and that’s okay.\n\nOpencode is great because of the open source nature, I can add features or fix things… but it is definitely more buggy than amp and droid. It’s like Linux vs Mac, more customization and tweaking but less of the “just works”.\n\nAt that point if you have a strong presence it might make sense to buy tokens through Factory/Droid or Amp, but for me because I prefer the optionality of harnesses, I mainly stick with subs.",

So you get\n\nu1, a1, u2, a2, u3, a3, u4, a4\n                             \\- u3 (can modify)\n\nYou can optionally add a summary for the branch you are leaving up until the common ancestory. So then you get\n\nu1, a1, u2, a2, u3, a3, u4, a4\n                             \\- (u3-u4) summary, new message\n\nThat summary also follows a strict output format and also tracks all file reads/modifications.\n\nAnd you can label branches, to quickly find them in the tree-selector UI.\n\nUsed it a bunch now for work on the big refactor, and it's kinda nice.",

    "content": "Just finished implementing \"structured compaction\" in pi. At least what I could gather from @FactoryAI  's blog post.\n\nModel that compacts is given:\n- previous compaction summary following a strict format\n- messages to compact\n- instructions to generate a new compaction summary following the strict format, merging it with the old one, updating done/todo/progress sections accordingly\n\nIn addition, the harness tracks file read/modified files via read/write/edit tool calls since the last compaction. Those get merged with the file operations recorded for the last compaction.\n\nIs this perfect? Definitely not. It relies on the compacting model not to get confused and actually retain and merge all the items of the previous compaction result (minus file ops, which are managed deterministically). \n\nIn super long sessions, this will also likely fall on its face eventually, as the compacting model only has so much output token space to emit the new merged summary.\n\nBut it's probably better than the old compaction scheme .",
