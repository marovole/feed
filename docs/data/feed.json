I’m actually just scratching my head wondering what the fuck, why is this thing only giving me halfway thought out results and leaving massive gaps? It’s not that what it’s outputting is wrong but it’s just leaving a shit load of code/thought process that should be there out of what it’s generating. \n\nLike I said, I hope I’m wrong.

    "content": "BREAKING:\n\nGemini 3 Pro is out!! It's state of the art (or close) on coding, reasoning, computer use and more. It's also extremely fast. \n\nWe've been testing it internally @every for a few hours. Here's what we've noticed so far:\n\n- Coding. It rips in @FactoryAI's Droid. So fast that after it finished @DannyAziz97 thought it hadn't even started. Code quality seems very high too.\n- Writing. In our early tests, it's not as a good of a writer or editor as Sonnet or Haiku—it's worse at telling whether writing is interesting.\n- Long-context understanding. Gemini 3 has a massive context window, and it can use it. I found it was able to find, synthesize, and use pieces of information in a long book draft for example, that other models usually.\n- @simonw's Pelican benchmark. Most important: it's really good at drawing a pelican on a bicycle.\n\nWe'll have a full hands-on vibe check on @every tomorrow, going through coding, writing, and API use. Stay tuned!",

About three weeks ago, I switched from Augment to CC for reasons I won’t mention here, but I think most people in the community already know why.
