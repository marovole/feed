I’ve used several AI coding tools like Augment, Kilo, Roo, and others.\n\nI’m a heavy user, my projects usually go beyond 50k lines of code. About three weeks ago, I switched from Augment to CC for reasons I won’t mention here, but I think most people in the community already know why. A teammate shared a factory reference code with me, so I decided to test it",
