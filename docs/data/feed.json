The Claude Code extension for VSC works perfectly fine in this setup, however I found that the droid extension is not recognized by the CLI when a WSL workspace is open. It instantly starts working when i open the windows native droid CLI in a non WSL workspace in VSC. I also found that trying to install the extension through the `/settings` menu simply fails when inside WSL. ",
